This sub-directory includes some cell lines sample phasing with switching errors and Wakhan updated phasing correction.

Default directory for each cell line contains coverage plots for each chromosome output direct from haplotagged BAMs while arbitrary directory contains coverage plots after fixing phase-switch errors through this tool.

Bin size for these cell lines coverage plots is set 50K, which can be adjusted as per requirements through `--bin-size` parameter.

Breakpoints/structural variations based segmentation and copy number estimation plots are also included for each cell line.
